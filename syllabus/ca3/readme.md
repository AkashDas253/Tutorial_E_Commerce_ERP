## **5. Given two prime numbers 31 and 29, design an RSA system. Explain with an example how it works.**

**Ans:**

### **Step 1: Choose Two Prime Numbers (\( p \) & \( q \))**
Given:
\( p = 31 \)
\( q = 29 \)

### **Step 2: Compute \( n \) (Modulus)**
\( n = p \times q = 31 \times 29 = 899 \)
\( n \) is used as the modulus for both public and private keys.

### **Step 3: Compute \( \phi(n) \) (Euler’s Totient Function)**
\( \phi(n) = (p-1) \times (q-1) = (31-1) \times (29-1) = 30 \times 28 = 840 \)

### **Step 4: Choose Public Key \( e \)**
\( e \) should be \( 1 < e < \phi(n) \) and \( \gcd(e, \phi(n)) = 1 \).
Let’s choose \( e = 7 \) (as \( \gcd(7, 840) = 1 \)).

### **Step 5: Compute Private Key \( d \)**
\( d \) is the modular multiplicative inverse of \( e \) modulo \( \phi(n) \), meaning:
\( d \times e \equiv 1 \pmod{\phi(n)} \)
Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm,
\( d = 721 \)
(since \( 7 \times 721 = 5047 \equiv 1 \pmod{840} \)).

### **Step 6: RSA Key Pair**
- **Public Key:** \( (e, n) = (7, 899) \)
- **Private Key:** \( (d, n) = (721, 899) \)

---

### **Example: Encryption & Decryption**
Let’s encrypt the message \( M = 5 \).

#### **Encryption Formula:**
\( C = M^e \mod n \)
\( C = 5^7 \mod 899 \)
\( C = 78125 \mod 899 = 626 \)
Thus, the **ciphertext** is **626**.

#### **Decryption Formula:**
\( M = C^d \mod n \)
\( M = 626^{721} \mod 899 \)
Using modular exponentiation,
\( M = 5 \)
Thus, the **original message is recovered** successfully.

This demonstrates how RSA encryption and decryption work using the given prime numbers.

---

### **Example of C2C E-Commerce**  
A person wants to sell a used smartphone. They list it on **eBay**, providing images, descriptions, and pricing. Another consumer interested in purchasing the phone places an order and makes an online payment. The seller ships the item, and once the buyer confirms receipt, the payment is finalized.  

**Platforms facilitating C2C E-Commerce:**  
- **eBay** – Auction-based and direct sales.  
- **OLX** – Localized selling and buying.  
- **Etsy (for handmade goods)** – Consumer artisans selling to other consumers.  

C2C e-commerce enables individuals to monetize unused goods, creating a second-hand market with minimal business involvement.
