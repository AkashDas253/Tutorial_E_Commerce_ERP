## **4. Draw a flowchart showing transaction flow in an E-Cash System.**  

**Ans:**  

### **Definition of E-Cash System**  
E-Cash (Electronic Cash) is a **digital currency** that allows users to make secure transactions over the internet. It functions like physical cash but is stored electronically and can be transferred between users and merchants without the need for a third-party intermediary.

### **Transaction Flow in an E-Cash System**  
The **E-Cash transaction process** involves the following steps:  

1. **User Requests E-Cash** – A customer requests digital cash from their bank.  
2. **Bank Verifies User Account** – The bank checks the user's balance and authentication.  
3. **Bank Issues E-Cash** – After verification, the bank deducts the amount and issues encrypted e-cash.  
4. **User Makes Purchase** – The user uses the e-cash to pay for goods or services online.  
5. **Merchant Receives E-Cash** – The seller receives the digital payment from the customer.  
6. **Merchant Sends E-Cash to Bank** – The merchant deposits the received e-cash into their bank account.  
7. **Bank Verifies E-Cash** – The bank checks the authenticity of the e-cash to prevent fraud or double-spending.  
8. **Bank Deposits Amount in Merchant’s Account** – After verification, the equivalent amount is credited to the merchant's account.  
9. **Transaction Complete** – The payment process is successfully completed.  

### **Flowchart Representation**  

```mermaid

## **5. Given two prime numbers 31 and 29, design an RSA system. Explain with an example how it works.**

**Ans:**

### **Step 1: Choose Two Prime Numbers (\( p \) & \( q \))**
Given:
\( p = 31 \)
\( q = 29 \)

### **Step 2: Compute \( n \) (Modulus)**
\( n = p \times q = 31 \times 29 = 899 \)
\( n \) is used as the modulus for both public and private keys.

### **Step 3: Compute \( \phi(n) \) (Euler’s Totient Function)**
\( \phi(n) = (p-1) \times (q-1) = (31-1) \times (29-1) = 30 \times 28 = 840 \)

### **Step 4: Choose Public Key \( e \)**
\( e \) should be \( 1 < e < \phi(n) \) and \( \gcd(e, \phi(n)) = 1 \).
Let’s choose \( e = 7 \) (as \( \gcd(7, 840) = 1 \)).

### **Step 5: Compute Private Key \( d \)**
\( d \) is the modular multiplicative inverse of \( e \) modulo \( \phi(n) \), meaning:
\( d \times e \equiv 1 \pmod{\phi(n)} \)
Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm,
\( d = 721 \)
(since \( 7 \times 721 = 5047 \equiv 1 \pmod{840} \)).

### **Step 6: RSA Key Pair**
- **Public Key:** \( (e, n) = (7, 899) \)
- **Private Key:** \( (d, n) = (721, 899) \)

---

### **Example: Encryption & Decryption**
Let’s encrypt the message \( M = 5 \).

#### **Encryption Formula:**
\( C = M^e \mod n \)
\( C = 5^7 \mod 899 \)
\( C = 78125 \mod 899 = 626 \)
Thus, the **ciphertext** is **626**.

#### **Decryption Formula:**
\( M = C^d \mod n \)
\( M = 626^{721} \mod 899 \)
Using modular exponentiation,
\( M = 5 \)
Thus, the **original message is recovered** successfully.

This demonstrates how RSA encryption and decryption work using the given prime numbers.

- **On-Premises EDI** – Installed within an organization’s infrastructure.  
- **Cloud-Based EDI** – Hosted on cloud platforms, allowing remote access.  
- **EDI via VAN (Value-Added Network)** – Uses third-party networks for secure communication.  
- **Web-Based EDI** – Allows small businesses to exchange EDI documents via a web interface.  

---

### **EDI Components**  

| Component | Description |  
|-----------|------------|  
| **EDI Standards** | Defines document formats (e.g., ANSI X12, EDIFACT, TRADACOMS). |  
| **EDI Translator** | Converts business data into EDI format and vice versa. |  
| **EDI Communication Protocols** | Ensures secure data exchange (e.g., AS2, FTP, HTTP, VAN). |  
| **EDI Mapping** | Transforms data between internal applications and EDI format. |  
| **EDI Gateway** | Manages inbound and outbound EDI messages. |  
| **EDI Integration** | Connects EDI software with ERP, CRM, and other business systems. |

## **8. Explain C2C E-Commerce with an Appropriate Example**  

**Ans:**  

### **Definition of C2C E-Commerce**  
Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) e-commerce refers to online transactions where consumers sell products or services directly to other consumers, typically through third-party platforms. These platforms provide a marketplace, payment services, and dispute resolution.  

---

### **Characteristics of C2C E-Commerce**  
- Direct transactions between consumers.  
- Platforms act as intermediaries (e.g., eBay, OLX).  
- Users can buy or sell new or used products.  
- Payments handled through secure gateways.  

---

### **Example of C2C E-Commerce**  
A person wants to sell a used smartphone. They list it on **eBay**, providing images, descriptions, and pricing. Another consumer interested in purchasing the phone places an order and makes an online payment. The seller ships the item, and once the buyer confirms receipt, the payment is finalized.  

**Platforms facilitating C2C E-Commerce:**  
- **eBay** – Auction-based and direct sales.  
- **OLX** – Localized selling and buying.  
- **Etsy (for handmade goods)** – Consumer artisans selling to other consumers.  

C2C e-commerce enables individuals to monetize unused goods, creating a second-hand market with minimal business involvement.
